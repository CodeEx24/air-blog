## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- Install npm (comes with Node.js).

## Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install all required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create an `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and paste the following code:

## Running the Application

To start the frontend development server, run:

```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5174` or a similar local address.
